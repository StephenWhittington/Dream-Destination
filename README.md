# Dream Destination

## By Stephen Whittington

Dream Destination is an Interactive single webpage application,
calling on the google maps/places API built for user purpose to find
their next holiday destination along with information about accommodation bars/restaurants and tourist
attractions from the selected city. The webpage has a simple layout for the user to
navigate and is responsive on mobile and desktop.

## UX Process For My Website

[Link to my figma mockup](https://github.com/StephenWhittington/Dream-Destination/blob/master/assets/images/Dream%20Destination%20API%20(1).png)

I started with a desktop webpage mockup using figma, I wanted the webpage to be easy to use
and not confusing with a simple layout. Because it is a single page application
it needed to be clear for the user to navigate and get the correct information from
their search. For example I started with a modal button for my page but found it made
things a little confusing for the user and by removing it made the page more understandable.

This webpage helps the user achieve their goal with its simple layout,navigation
and Interactive map where they can select the destination and get detailed results back
with pictures. The user wants to get information quickly with little effort and this webpage
helps them achieve that goal.
